= Introduction =

Injex is a Visual Studio 2010 solution. You can download the latest release source from the [http://code.google.com/p/injex/downloads/list Downloads] section. It is designed to be a template to use to make your injectable DLL and a platform to inject it.

= Getting It Running =

You can get the latest copy of injex running in just a few simple steps:

  # Make sure you have the prerequisits:
    * Visual Studio 2010 installed or at least [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express Visual C++ Express 2010].
    * [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062 SysInternal Suite]
  # Download the latest source RAR from [http://code.google.com/p/injex/downloads/list Downloads].
  # Unpack it to a directory of your choice.
  # Navigate to that directory in explorer.
  # Double click *injex.sln*.
  # Once the solution is open press Ctrl+Shift+B to build the solution.
  # Open a command prompt at the build directory.
  # Run "dbgview.exe" from SysInternal Suite.
  # Run the command `injex -d injexdll.dll -b notepad.exe`.
  # Notepad will open, write some stuff in it and go to save it.
  # When notepad saves the file you will see dbgview print a message.
  # Congrats! You have injected your first Injex DLL.

Now to customize the DLL, you will edit the function "start" inside of the project named "injexdll". Good luck!
